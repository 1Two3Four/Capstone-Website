I have always had an interest in computers ever since I was a child, and currently plan on attending the University of Waterloo in Ontario for Computer Engineering. I am president of Killarney’s Programming Club, and was a judge and organizer for vsHacks, an online hackathon held in the Vancouver School District. My hobbies include learning Japanese, reading manga, playing video games, and, of course, coding. My favourite band is the Japanese band Fishmans.</p>
